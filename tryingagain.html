                  <p>This paper considers the expanding body of evidence concerning portrayals of violence against women in the news media. We then review the content of a selection of international media reporting guidelines developed to address such concerns. We demonstrate that despite similarities in content, much less is known about processes by which the guidelines have been developed and disseminated.</p>

                  <p>Violence against women is a global public health problem.
                    There is growing international Interest in how to prevent this pervasive human rights violation.
                    It is within this context that the media-a dominant force in shaping the discourse on matters of public importance is seen to play a crucial role. This paper considers the expanding body of evidence concerning portrayals of violence against women in the news and the impact that reporting may have on community understanding attitudes and behaviors.
                     To date, most research attention has focused on how media messages about violence against women are framed in the news.</p>
                  <h3>Media stop retraumatizing survivors</h3>
                  <p>Media Obtain survivors consent before featuring their stories or personal details. Protect anonymity, maintain the privacy and confidentiality of survivors by using pseudonyms, blurring faces or altering or altering voices avoiding any identifying information that could lead to their identification.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Avoid stigmatizing language</li>
                    <li>Stop blaming the victim </li>
                    <li>Reframe from using survivors stories for public stunt.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The Right Approach:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Seek explict consent from survivors or survivors guidance if not up to 18 years</li>
                    <li>Use sensitive language that is respectful, empathetic, and traumafree.</li>
                    <li>Media reports should listen actively and not putting survivors in a state of compromising thier story</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>Social context:</h2>
                  <dl>
                    One of the key themes identifed in our review was that media reports of violence against women were highly skewed towards event-based reporting or “episodic framing”
                    (Bou-Franch, 2013; Halim & Meyers, 2010; Marhia, 2008; Maxwell, Huxford, Borum & Hornik,
                    2000; McManus & Dorfman, 2005; Sims, 2008). These are news reports that focus primarily
                    on discrete incidents or events located at specifc places and times while largely ignoring the
                    overarching social context in which violence against women occurs. This fnding is important
                    because the way stories are framed can impact on how audiences assign responsibility. Episodic
                    framing tends to elicit individualistic rather than societal attributions of responsibility. Thematic
                    framing, which includes elements of the social context of the crime, tends to have the opposite
                    effect (Scheufele, 1999). Failure to present murder within the context of intimate partner violence
                    was noted frequently among studies investigating media depictions of intimate partner homicide
                    (Bullock, 2010; Bullock & Cubert, 2002; Easteal, Bartels, Nelson & Holland, 2015; Morgan &
                    Politoff, 2012; Richards, Gillespie & Smith, 2011; Taylor, 2009; Wozniak & McCloskey, 2010).
                      </dl>
                  <h2>Sensationalism:</h2>
                  <dl>
                    Another key theme that emerged from the review concerned the tendency for
news stories about violence against women to be sensationalised. Sensationalist news reporting can manifest in which stories are chosen to feature in the news, which facts are included
and emphasised, what is omitted, the language that is used and other feature-writing devices
that are employed to create dramatic tension (Grabe, Zhou & Barnett, 2001; Ricketson, 2004).
In our review, studies consistently found that the stories that gained most traction tended not to
focus on the most common forms of violence perpetrated against women but were instead concerned with the most severe forms of physical violence, fatal incidents, random acts of violence
and violence perpetrated by women (Carlyle, Slater & Chakroff, 2008; Marhia, 2008; Mason & Monckton-Smith, 2008; Morgan & Politoff, 2012; Sims, 2008). Researchers commonly noted,
for instance, that female perpetrators of violence refected the news value of novelty (Anastasio &
Costa, 2004; Easteal et al., 2015; Jackson, 2013; Naylor, 2001; Noh, Lee & Feltey, 2010; Skilbrei,
2013), with violence by women considered “more deviant, more anxiety-provoking, more transgressive than men’s violence” (Naylor, 2001, p. 188). Researchers also noted that sensational and
exceptional language was commonly used in media reports of violence against women (Ahmed,
2014; Alat, 2006; Comas-d’Argemir, 2014; End Violence Against Women Coalition, 2012; Evans, 2001; Jackson, 2013; Mason & Monckton-Smith, 2008; O’Hara, 2012)

                      </a>
                  </p>
                  <h2>Misrepresentations and “rape myths”:</h2>
                  <p> While a number of studies found that media commonly
                    perpetuate myths and misconceptions about violence against women, it was particularly problematic among media portrayals of sexual violence. The term “rape myth” was coined by Brownmiller in 1975 and defned a few years later as being “prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs
                    about rape, rape victims and rapists” (Burt, 1980, p. 217). While it is acknowledged that a multitude of sources contribute to stereotypical constructions of sexual violence in the community, the
                    media play an active role. Understanding how the media perpetuate or challenge such stereotypes
                    was the focus of a number of studies identifed in our review (Bonnes, 2013; Dwyer, Easteal &
                    Hopkins, 2012; Franiuk, Seefelt, Cepress & Vandello, 2008; Franiuk, Seefelt & Vandello, 2008;
                    Jackson, 2013; O’Hara, 2012; Sampert, 2010; Toffoletti, 2007; Tranchese & Zollo, 2013). Key
                    fndings included a disproportionate amount of news coverage of cases involving stranger rape
                    and the tendency to portray both women and men as “other” by way of their culture, race, ethnicity and/or social standing – their “otherness” deriving from the notion that rape is an atypical occurrence perpetrated by, and against, wayward individuals (Barnett, 2012; Evans, 2001; Jackson,
                    2013; O’Hara, 2012; Sampert, 2010; Saroca, 2013; Toffoletti, 2007).
                    </p>
                  <h3>Blame and Responsibility</h3>
                  <p> Many studies identifed in our review highlighted the way news media construct stories that either directly or indirectly attribute blame and/or assign responsibility
                    for violence to women (Barnett, 2012; Dwyer et al., 2012; Evans, 2001; Gillespie, Richards, Givens & Smith, 2013; Richards et al., 2011; Roberto, McCann & Brossoie, 2013; Saroca, 2013). It is
                    most often referred to in the literature as “victim blaming”, and refers to circumstances in which
                    victims of crime are portrayed so that it appears they are partially or entirely responsible for
                    the transgressions committed against them. Overall, studies included in the review showed that
                    attributing blame and assigning responsibility was mostly not overt but was mediated through
                    subtle gendered messages. Such messages were promulgated by how the stories were structured,
                    the language used, the order in which incidents were described and whether coverage included
                    information on precipitating factors or other reasons that could shift the blame from male perpetrators to women. For example, reportage that focuses on safety campaigns and messages informing women about strategies to avoid being a victim of male violence can inadvertently work to
                    construct avoidance of violence as the responsibility of women, as opposed to perpetrators, and
                    unwittingly perpetuate victim-blaming attitudes (Carline & Easteal, 2014, p. 258).</p>

                  <p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.
                     There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030.
Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and therefore also half of its potential. But gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress.
On average, women in the labor market still earn 23 percent less than men globally and women spend about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men.
            </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p> Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office, all remain huge barriers. All these areas of inequality have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: there has been a surge in reports of sexual violence, women have taken on more care work due to school closures, and 70% of health and social workers globally are women.
                         <strong>At the current rate, it will take an estimated 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to close gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws, 140 years for women to be represented equally in positions of power and leadership in the workplace, and 47 years to achieve equal representation in national parliaments.</strong> 
                         Political leadership, investments and comprehensive policy reforms are needed to dismantle systemic barriers to achieving Goal 5 Gender equality is a cross-cutting objective and must be a key focus of national policies, budgets and institutions.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>In many areas, progress has been too slow. At the current rate, it will take an estimated 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to close gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws, 140 years for women to be represented equally in positions of power and leadership in the workplace, and 47 years to achieve equal representation in national parliaments.</p>
